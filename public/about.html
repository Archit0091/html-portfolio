<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Archit Ranjan—a passionate software developer with a relentless drive for innovation. 
  Currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Applications (MCA) at Lovely Professional University, 
  Phagwara, Punjab, I specialize in C, C++, Java, MySQL, and web technologies like HTML, CSS, 
  and JavaScript. I thrive on solving complex problems and crafting efficient, scalable solutions.</p>

<p>I have worked on exciting projects, including an Online Farmer Management System and a 
  Multi-Vendor Marketplace, which have honed my skills in database management, software engineering, 
  and full-stack development. I am deeply fascinated by cybersecurity, database systems, and 
  object-oriented programming, always eager to dive deeper into emerging technologies.</p>

<p>Beyond the world of coding, I express my creativity through painting, music, and travel, and I 
  have a keen interest in learning new languages. I’m also a fitness enthusiast, recently venturing 
  into the world of calisthenics to challenge myself physically and mentally.</p>

<p>I am always eager to learn, innovate, and collaborate on exciting projects. 
  My goal is to become a versatile software developer, continuously learning 
  and adapting to new technologies.
